# Wordle Solver

Guessing algrorithm for Wordle written in Python

## Installation & Usage

Clone the repository and run either solver scripts

```bash
python3 wordlesolver.py
Enter 'a' to run the guessing algorithm on Absurdle
Enter 'm' to give the guessing algorithm a word of your own to guess
(every word is allowed for manual therefore the average attempts required increases)

Choose a mode: w
1. salet
2. jirga
3. krona
4. aroma
```

## How it works

Once the algorithm has hints for a guess, it converts them into match data (known positions, impossible positions, minimum count and if there could be any more of the letter) for every letter in the alphablet.

Then based on each letter's match data words that won't be possible are removed.

After the list of possible words is shortend a word is chosen through the choose_word function to be the new guess to then get hints for and shorten the possiblities further.

With the solution as "aroma":

â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›â¬› First guess is always salet [(statistically the best)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRed0Xmc2Wg)

â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨â¬›ðŸŸ© Second guess is decor sice there's no more of a or n but there's c, r and e somewhere else

â¬›ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â¬›ðŸŸ© The guesses repeat the same process as the second until it reaches the solution

ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ© The solution is found by the fourth guess

For 100 random solutions the algorithm averaged (yet to calculate) tries to get to the solution.

## Choosing words

Given a list of possible words, if you rank every word by what ratio match it is to every guess made till now and choose the one with the lowest rank, you'll get a word that adds the maximum amount of new letters and positions to the existing pool of letters.

```python
def choose_word(guesses: set, possible_words: set, randomize: bool = False):
    """Get an optimized choice of a word to be the next guess from the possible words"""

    if randomize: return random.choice(list(possible_words))
    comparison = {}
    # The best next guess seems to be the one that differs most from the previous guesses
    # since this diversifys the letters used therefore maximizing the hints received

    for word in possible_words:
        for guess in guesses:
            # get the similarity between the word and the guess
            comparison[word] = comparison.get(word, 0) + SequenceMatcher(
                None, word, guess).ratio()
        # number of total letters - number of unique letters
        comparison[word] = comparison.get(word, 0) + len(word) - len(set(word))

    return min(comparison, key=comparison.get)
```
